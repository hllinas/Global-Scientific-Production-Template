# Global-Scientific-Production-Template

<h1 style="color: darkblue;">Global Scientific Production Template</h1>
<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">Includes Log Coloring, 1:110m Scale, and Labels, </h3>

This interactive map is inspired by the original work *CountrySciProd Project* by [AlexanderRV22](https://github.com/Alex-rv150/CountrySciProud), which offers a global overview of **scientific production** through visual analytics. Building on that foundation, this version incorporates enhancements such as:

- Logarithmic color scale.
- 1:110m small scale projection.
- Dynamic country labels displaying names and frequencies.

Designed for researchers, educators, and policymakers, this tool allows users to explore how different countries contribute to scientific research. The visualization supports deeper insights into scientific output worldwide, and the code can be easily modified to reflect custom frequency data or labeling preferences.
